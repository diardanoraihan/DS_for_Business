## Project Summary
Data science is a science of extracting useful information from a large, structured or unstructured amount of data to help business (company) solve problems. The practice includes data collection, data cleaning, data analysis and visualization, and machine learning modeling. 

In this project, I leverage my data science skills to maximize business revenue, reduce cost, and optimize businesses process. I apply data science techniques to the following 6 departments:
- __Human Resources__: Build AI models to reduce employees hiring and training costs by predicting which employees might leave the company. See the project [here](https://github.com/diardanoraihan/DS_for_Business/tree/main/Human%20Resources%20Department).
- __Marketing__: Optimize marketing strategy to launch a targeted campaign by performing customer segmentation. See the project [here](https://github.com/diardanoraihan/DS_for_Business/tree/main/Marketing%20Department).
- __Sales__: Develop time series forecasting models to predict future product prices. See the project [here](https://github.com/diardanoraihan/DS_for_Business/tree/main/Sales%20Department).
- __Operations__: Use Deep Learning to automate the process of detecting and classifying chest diseases in a hospital. See the project [here](https://github.com/diardanoraihan/DS_for_Business/tree/main/Operations%20Department)
- __Public Relations__: _Coming soon_
- __Production/Maintenance__: _Coming soon_
