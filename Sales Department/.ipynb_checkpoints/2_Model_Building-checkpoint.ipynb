    "__Prophet__ is an open source software released by Facebook's Core Data Science Team as a procedure for forecasting time series data based on an additive model where non-linear trends are fit with yearly, weekly and daily seasonality, plus holiday effects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Prophet works best with time series data that have strong seasonal effects and several seasons of historical data, such as:\n",
    "- Sales three years in the past with all the seasonalities in there (holidays, weekend, weather, etc).\n",
    "- With all these information, the model can predict the expected sales may be in the next two months. \n",
    "\n",
    "The model is pretty accurate, and therefore Facebook itself uses this tool internally to do the planning like:\n",
    "- demand planning in the future,\n",
    "- number of customers forecasting model to visit the site at the specific time in the future.\n",
